# Brisingr
I thoroughly enjoyed reading Brisingr. I read it for the first time as a teenager as the series came out and it still holds a special place in my heart. There is some violence and I'll admit it's not the most polished or original story, but I enjoyed it a lot.

## Ratings

This book doesn't use any real swear words that I can recall, though it does use (rarely) use substitutes. There is no sexual content between characters. There is some violence in this book. It is not overly graphic, but at times it does go into detail about the anatomy of different sword wounds and the like.

Overall, I would feel comfortable recommending this book to a friend or family member.
