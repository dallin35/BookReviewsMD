## Rating and Review ****
I've read a handful of books about racism in the United States following the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests in an attempt to better understand what life is like for Black people in America. Of the books I've read, I think this one is my second favorite (following The New Jim Crowe) because it's written in a very accessible way, it backs its claims up with both anecdotes and data, and it makes interesting points no other books I've read do.

I wouldn't recommend this book to a conservative as a way of trying to open their eyes to racism in America. It covers a lot of topics (such as the intersectionality of gender, sexuality and race discrimination) that strongly right-leaning people will completely disregard. 

That being said, I do feel like Ibram X. Kendi does a great job of relating his own experiences coming to grips with the prejudices he's felt in his life for various groups. He presents a great model of open-mindedness.

## Content M.L3.S2.V2
I would definitely recommend this book to certain audiences, but for people like my conservative relatives, I don't think it would be well-received. For individuals like that, I think I'd recomend The New Jim Crowe instead. 

I'm not exactly sure how explicit any of the content areas of this book are. I think it's pretty much middle-of-the-road.

### Recommendability: Maybe
See the paragraph above to see my thoughts about whether this book is worth recommending or not.


### Language: 3
I think this book does have some more severe swear words in the form of quotes. There is no common, casual use of the more egregious "cuss" words.

### Sex: 2
The book spends a decent amount of time talking about sexuality, but doesn't ever describe any kind of intercourse.

### Violence: 2
The book may contain accounts of violence against Black people. I don't remember feeling that it was very graphic in this manner, however.
