## Rating and Review *****
I loved this book. I had just finished reading the Inheritance Cycle when I started reading it and was a little worried I would feel disoriented and that I wouldn't get invested in the story, but I did. I liked the characters so much and found that I really cared what happened to them.

This story was an interesting take on a pretty typical fantasy world and I really enjoyed it.

## Content Y.L2.S2.V3
This was a great book that I would definitely recommend. There isn't much to be concerned about as far as content goes.

### Recommendability: Yes
This book is great. I highly recommend it. I don't really know what else to say.

### Language: 2
This book might swear like one time, but if it did, it wasn't a very "severe" swear word. I'm just putting it at 2 to be safe.

### Sex: 2
There were a few references to sex, a couple mentions of adultery, and maybe a little inuendo. At no point in the plot do any characters have sex (on screen) and there are no descriptions of the act of sex.

### Violence: 3
This book did have some violence with a moderate level of blood and gore. There are fight scenes with swords and spears with typical sword and spear injuries and there is one mauling.
