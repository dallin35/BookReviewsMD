# Star Rating Philosophy
The five star rating system that has become so popularized thanks to Amazon and Goodreads is such a poor indicator of the quality of a book. Notwithstanding the flaws of that system, I feel compelled to constrain myself to it because of its universal adoption. I will, however, clarify what each specific star count means to me in order to dispel some measure of its ambiguity.

DISCLAIMER: This rating system is completely subjective based on my opinions and feelings. It should not be held as an objective evaluation of the quality or content of a story.

## 1 Star
A one star book is a book that I didn't enjoy reading at all. Such a book will be "poorly written" with a non-compelling story.

## 2 Stars
Two stars means I feel the book was poorly written, but that it had some redeeming qualities.

## 3 Stars
Any book I rate 3 stars or above is a book I consider well-written. After this point, the difference in star rating is based on my enjoyment of the book or how much value I feel like it added to my life.

A 3 star book is a well-written book that I personally didn't enjoy reading so much. Typically this will mean that the book is not to my taste

## 4 Stakrs
A 4 star book is a well-written book that I enjoyed reading.
