# Fairbanks Content Rating System
One of my greatest frustrations with reading books is that there are no content warnings like movies have. I hate being surprised by graphic content or strong language in a book I was looking forward to reading. For that reason, I have decided to develop my own rating system. It won't help me avoid books with content I don't want to read, but it will help me record the kind of content contained in a book and make appropriate recommendations to friends and family.

## Brief Explanation
There are 3 content segments of the rating (Language, Sex, and Violence) and one overarching "Would I be comfortable recommending this book to a friend?" segment. Each content segment is scored from one to five based on specific criteria listed below in their relative sections. The format of the rating system is as follows:

```
Y.L3.S2.V4
```
* The first letter corresponds to the "Recommendability" of the book. An "N" indicates that I would not recommend the book while a "Y" indicates that I would. This segment of the rating is subjectively based on my opinions.
* The second digit is the "Language" segment.
* The Third corresponds to the sexual content of the book.
* The final digit is associated with the violence portrayed in the book.

See below for explanations of what each level means for each content segment.
