## Rating and Review *****
I loved this novella. I couldn't help falling in love with the narrating "Murderbot." I spent most of the book feeling like the cyborg/robot needed a hug. 

Martha Wells crafted a compelling short story with enough character work and plot to be compelling. The world-building of this far-futuristic sci-fi novella did not disappoint. I'm excited to read the next entries in the series.
