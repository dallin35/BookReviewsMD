## Rating and Review ****
This was an excellent conclusion to the Inheritance Saga. I just finished it a few minutes ago and it honestly has given me a little bit of post-book depression. I've enjoyed rereading this series a lot and it's kind of hard to say goodbye to its characters--especially the way the book ends.

All-in-all it was a very satisfying conclusion to the serires. The climax was both creative and (somewhat) believable and the denoument filled in many of the gaps and polished things off well.

## Content Y.L1.S2.V3
The only thing even potentially bothersome (in my opinion) about Inheritence is the violence. The content in this book is not too mature for most readers.

### Recommendability: Yes
I enjoyed this book a lot, and none of its content is graphic or inappropriate enough that it would give me pause in recommending it to someone else.

### Language: 1
There is virutally no language at all in this book. At the worst, there may be one or two times the book says something along the lines of "he swore."

### Sex: 2
There are occasional references to sex, but not in any detail. There is one point where it is made clear that two dragons are mating, but again, that's not portrayed in any detail.

### Violence: 3
This book contains accounts of many battles and many injuries inlcuding some torture. The injuries (including stab wounds) are, at times, explained in detail, but usually just enough to get the idea of what has occurred. 

This book could potentially be too violent for some readers.
