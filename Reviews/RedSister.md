## Rating and Review ***
This book is very unique. It presents a very unique setting for its characters. The world building was fascinating--I loved reading about the state of the world and contemplating how it might have ended up that way. The magic system was also very orginal (as far as I'm aware).

The characters felt a little flat to me and I wasn't very invested in any of them (except for Nona) or their relationships.

Additionally, I was more committed to the world and the concepts than the actual plot of the story. In my opinion, the plot jumped around quite a bit and I wansn't as invested in the resolution of the major conflict as I should have been.

## Content M.L4.S3.V4
Disclaimer: It's been over a month since I read the book and while I remember the major plot details, smaller things like whether or not there was language or whether or not there was any sexual dialogue have begun to slip through my mind.

I will Need to read the book again before giving too much weight to the ratings.

### Recommendability: Maybe
I enjoyed this book, but I can definitely understand that it wouldn't be for everyone. There is a lot of violence and it's set in a rather dark world. 

### Language: 4
I can't remember super well what the language was like in this book. If I had to guess, I would say it contained casual and frequent use of at least moderate swear words and potentially some regular use of the "F word" as well.

### Sex: 3
If there was sexual content in this book, I'm fairly certain it was just references to sex as a concept, not descriptions of the act itself.

### Violence: 4
This is a story about warrior nuns; there is a lot of violence.
