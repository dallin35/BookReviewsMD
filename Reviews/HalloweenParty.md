## Rating and Review *****
Agatha Christie is amazing. This is another great murder mystery. Truth is, I was listening to the audiobook and it wasn't even a regular audiobook, it was like a theatrical version that was literally only dialogue from different voice actors, so I wasn't paying super good attention. I should probably read it again tbh.

## Content Y.L1.S1.V3
The only potential concern anyone could have with this book is that it is a murder mystery. If that's not you're cup of tea, you probably shouldn't be reading Agatha Christie.   

### Recommendability: Yes
It's a great book. Unique story. Enjoyable read.    

### Language: 1
I don't think any of Agatha's books have any language. I might be wrong about that. I'll have to pay more attention in the future.

### Sex: 1
If I recall correctly, I don't think there was a single reference to sex. I don't believe there was any romantic interaction at all.

### Violence: 3
It's a murder mystery. There are no fights or active violence portrayed, but the whole story centers on the murder of a child, which could potentially be disturbing.
